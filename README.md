A silly go program to get a feel for golang. What I want to do is make a randon number guessing game.

ok Franco, do you know the way [yes/no]?
if they say yes... What is the way? [0-10]
if they are correct...go job you know the way.
if the guess wrong, then it will say something silly then ask if it knows the way.
